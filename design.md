# Rust Analog Synth Design Document

## 1. Overview and Goals

This document outlines the design for a Rust-based analog synthesizer simulator. Our primary goals are:

1. Create a modular, extensible system that can grow from a basic synthesizer to a complex one.
2. Ensure clean separation of concerns between audio processing, UI, and MIDI handling.
3. Maintain real-time performance for audio processing.
4. Allow for easy addition of new features and components.
5. Leverage Rust's strengths in safety, concurrency, and performance.

## 2. Architecture Design

We will use a layered architecture with clear interfaces between components:

```
+-------------------+
|    User Interface |
+-------------------+
          |
+-------------------+
|    MIDI Handler   |
+-------------------+
          |
+-------------------+
|    Synth Engine   |
+-------------------+
    |            |
+-------+    +-------+
| Voice |    |Effects|
+-------+    +-------+
```

## 3. Component Breakdown

1. **Synth Engine**: Coordinates all audio processing.
   - Manages voices using an object pool
   - Applies global effects
   - Handles audio device interaction

2. **Voice**: Represents a single synthesizer voice.
   - Contains Oscillator, Envelope, and Filter
   - Implemented as a struct with no runtime polymorphism

3. **Oscillator**: Generates raw waveforms.
   - Uses an enum for different waveform types
   - Implements a trait for common oscillator operations

4. **Envelope**: Modulates amplitude over time (ADSR).
   - Implemented as a struct with methods for each stage

5. **Filter**: Shapes the tone of the voice.
   - Uses traits for different filter types

6. **Effects**: Applies post-processing effects.
   - Implements a trait object-based plugin system for flexibility

7. **MIDI Handler**: Processes MIDI input.
   - Uses a custom enum for type-safe MIDI events

8. **User Interface**: Provides control over synth parameters.
   - Initially a simple CLI, later expandable to GUI
   - Communicates with audio thread via lock-free structures

## 4. Rust-Specific Design Considerations

1. **Thread Safety and Communication**:
   - Use `Arc<Mutex<>>` for shared state that requires complex operations
   - Implement a lock-free ring buffer for audio thread communication
   - Use atomics for simple shared state (e.g., global volume)

2. **Memory Management**:
   - Implement an object pool for voice allocation to avoid runtime allocations
   - Use `const` generics for fixed-size audio buffers

3. **Zero-Cost Abstractions**:
   - Define traits for Oscillator, Envelope, and Filter interfaces
   - Use static dispatch where possible for performance

4. **Type Safety**:
   - Implement newtype patterns for units like Frequency and Amplitude
   - Use a type-safe builder pattern for synth configuration

5. **Error Handling**:
   - Define a custom `SynthError` enum that encapsulates all possible errors
   - Use `Result` types consistently, avoiding panics in audio threads

6. **Concurrency Patterns**:
   - Use channels for non-real-time communication between threads
   - Explore lock-free data structures for real-time parameter updates

7. **Optimization**:
   - Utilize SIMD instructions for audio processing where applicable
   - Avoid allocations and blocking operations in the audio thread

## 5. File Structure

```
src/
    main.rs
    synth/
        mod.rs
        engine.rs
        voice.rs
        oscillator.rs
        envelope.rs
        filter.rs
        effects/
            mod.rs
            trait.rs
            reverb.rs
            delay.rs
        types.rs  // For newtype definitions
    midi/
        mod.rs
        handler.rs
        types.rs  // For MIDI-specific types and enums
    ui/
        mod.rs
        cli.rs
        gui.rs (to be implemented later)
    utils/
        mod.rs
        ring_buffer.rs
        object_pool.rs
    error.rs  // For custom error types
```

## 6. Key Rust Patterns and Features to Utilize

1. **Traits**: For defining common interfaces (e.g., `Oscillator`, `Effect`)
2. **Enums**: For representing different types (e.g., waveforms, MIDI events)
3. **Generics** and **PhantomData**: For type-safe configurations
4. **Atomic Types**: For lock-free sharing of simple values
5. **Channels**: For communication between non-audio threads
6. **Unsafe Code**: Carefully used for performance-critical sections, with clear safety documentation
7. **Macros**: For generating repetitive code (e.g., parameter setters)
8. **Type State Pattern**: For enforcing correct usage of the synthesizer API

## 7. Testing Strategy

1. Unit tests for individual components (oscillators, envelopes, etc.)
2. Integration tests for the complete synthesizer
3. Fuzzing tests for MIDI input handling
4. Benchmark tests for performance-critical sections
5. Property-based testing for mathematical correctness of audio algorithms

## 8. Future Considerations

1. Explore async Rust for non-audio tasks if beneficial
2. Consider FFI for integrating with existing audio or MIDI libraries
3. Investigate using WebAssembly for a web-based version of the synthesizer
